from Coffee-Script to Typescript and updated D3 syntax to v7.

Thank you to Dr. Broman for the excellent D3 examples!

The top panel is an image plot of phenotype, measured over time,
for many individuals.  The rows correspond to individuals.

Hover over a row to see the detailed time course below.

Click on a row and the curve below will be retained as you move
away.  Click again (if you can get your pointer onto it) and it will
be removed.
