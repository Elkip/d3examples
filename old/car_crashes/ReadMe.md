## Interactive graph of car crash statistics

I recently wrote a
[blog post](http://kbroman.wordpress.com/2014/10/29/improved-graphs-of-car-crash-stats/)
discussing revised versions of plots of car crash statistics by state,
using data from
[an interesting post](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/which-state-has-the-worst-drivers/)
by [Mona Chalabi](https://twitter.com/MonaChalabi) on
[fivethirtyeight](http://fivethirtyeight.com).

The present directory contains [D3](http://d3js.org) code for an
interactive version.

See it in action [here](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/D3/car_crashes).
