Pairwise marker recombination fractions and LOD scores
----------------------------------------------------------------------

See it in action [here](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/D3/recfrac2).

The plot has estimated recombination fractions above the diagonal and
LOD scores for a test of linkage below the diagonal.  

Hover over a point to get a view of the underlying values.

I'd intended to also show the two-locus genotype table, but it's
incomplete. (I moved on to other things and haven't come back to it
yet.)
